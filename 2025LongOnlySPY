Algorithm Timing Tracker for Smarter DCA

Overview

This spreadsheet serves as a public record comparing different methods of buying the SPY ETF (S&P 500 Index ETF) to optimize dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with an edge. By tracking execution times and performance, it helps determine whether timing dips can outperform a simple, consistent buying schedule.

Strategies Compared:

Dip Buying with SJ â€“ Allocating varying portions of cash when market dips occur.

Weekly Buying â€“ Buying on the same day each week (e.g., every Friday), regardless of price.

Monthly Buying â€“ Buying at the end of each month, regardless of price.

A Relative Dip Approach is also included, where larger dips relative to recent prices trigger more aggressive buying. This helps determine if strategic timing enhances returns compared to regular interval-based purchases.


How to Use

Key Sheets in the Spreadsheet:

SPY Price History â€“ Displays SPY ETFâ€™s price trends, including open/high/low/close prices and trading volume.

Timing vs. Weekly/Monthly Buys â€“ Compares the average cost basis of each buying approach and their gains/losses.

Emoji Dictionary (Steps Chart) â€“ A visual guide explaining the different stages of market conditions and buying decisions.


Reading the Data:

Stock Price ($): Closing price of SPY on a given date.

Weekly Buy Price ($): Cost basis if buying weekly.

Monthly Buy Price ($): Cost basis if buying monthly.

SJ Buy Price ($): Cost basis if using the dip-buying strategy.

Summary Row: Shows average buy prices for each approach and the corresponding gains/losses in both dollar and percentage terms.


Why This Matters for DCA

Traditional DCA buys at fixed intervals without considering market conditions. This spreadsheet helps implement a smarter DCA approach by:

Avoiding buying at highs and deploying cash during dips.

Tracking algorithm efficiency to optimize decision-making.

Testing different strategies to identify what works best over time.
