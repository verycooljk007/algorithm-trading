RoboAdvisor
Project Overview

This is specifically to improve on the roboadvisor function to avoid highs and swing to highs ideally.

This repository contains a spreadsheet I created to track algorithm execution times, specifically to analyze and optimize strategies for dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with an edge. By timing different algorithmic approaches, this project helps refine decision-making for better market entry points.
How to Use It

    View the Spreadsheet – 
    Analyze Timing Data – Compare execution times of different algorithms and their impact on DCA strategies. Added control groups buy buying weekly/monthly time frame
    Optimize Performance – Identify which methods offer the best efficiency for automated investing strategies.

Motivation

DCA is a powerful investing approach, but timing matters. This spreadsheet helps to avoid buying highs and lower cost per share applying algorithmic DCA strategies. By tracking performance, I aim to refine an approach that maximizes long-term gains while reducing poor market entry points.
